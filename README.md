A fully polished **Ping Pong game** built using **Python Pygame**, featuring synchronized **ball color + score color**, smooth paddle mechanics, AI opponent tracking, speed-increasing ball physics, and a clean, minimal UI.

## ▶ How the Game Works

* Ball starts in the center and moves automatically
* Player hits the ball using arrow keys
* Each hit:

  * Increases ball speed slightly
  * Changes ball color
  * Score color updates instantly
* AI paddle follows the ball with reduced speed
* If ball crosses a side:

  * Corresponding player gets a point
  * Ball resets to center
* Game ends when:

  * **Player score = 7**
  * OR **AI score = 7**
